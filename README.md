# FakeFuser

## VERY WORK IN PROGRESS! NOTHING REALLY WORKS RIGHT NOW!

A recreation of Harmonix's Fuser Web Services API.

Requires Node.js and Express.js (`npm install express`) - use a local proxy such as Fiddler to redirect the game for now.

Currently (8th December 2022) supports saying Yes to a Steam login and giving a pretty "Hello, World!" on the main menu. Probably doesn't work on Epic or NX versions of the game.
